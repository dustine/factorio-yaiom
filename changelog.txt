Version: 0.2.1
Date: 17.01.2018
  Minor features:
    - Productivity modules can be used with ferricupric cleaning/processing (not refining)
  Fixed:
    - Couldn't open fracking drills interface
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 17.01.2018
  Major features:
    - Moved the detection and usage of ferricupric earlier in the game (after oil/uranium)
    - Bedrock scanners now look for ore deposits
  Minor features:
    - Better icon graphics
    - Added a "decal" for ferricupric ore
  Balancing:
    - Moved one of the mining fluid input for the miners so they now form a cardinal
    - Made ferricupric more advantageous (better yields per uranium, more coal/oil returns)
  Deprecated:
    - Satellite scanning speed boosting
    - Renaming of all the prototypes (sorry)

Version: 0.1.0
Date: 15.01.2018
  Major features:
    - Hydraulic cracking, allows to mine hidden ores with high pressure liquid injection
    - Satellite coverage uncovers hidden ore spots over time on charted chunks, the more satellites the faster it'll be
    - Ferricupric ore, special hidden ore that can be refined into copper and iron, with traces of coal
  Minor features:
    - Setting to disable satellite hidden ore discovery
