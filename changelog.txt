Version: 1.2.3
Date: 24.01.2018
  Bugfixes:
    - Advanced processing only exported 50 ore per crafting (game limitation, changed recipes but kept throughput as a workaround).
    - Reworked how variables are indexed so I'm 100% sure desyncs can't be a thing now. For sure.
    - Beacons took x60 times longer to scan than intended.
  Balancing:
    - Increased uranium usage slightly, because of the item stack size bugfix. Sorry!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 22.01.2018
  Balancing:
    - Increased ferricupric mining speed by 2.5x (faster mining speed and power on miners).
    - Hydraulic miners now can have up to 4 modules now.
    - Advanced processing uses 1000 ore (x4) per enriched uranium, but takes twice as long now.

Version: 1.2.1
Date: 19.01.2018
  Bugfixes:
    - Possible desync over invalid surface reference.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 19.01.2018
  Minor features:
    - Already existing savegames (without the mod) will retroactively contain deep ore (hidden or not).
  Bugfixes:
    - Hidden ores now spawn by default on modded surfaces (autoplace.default_enabled is now true).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 18.01.2018
  Major features:
    - Research to allow satellites to scan for deep ore passively (using a beacon to activate this feature).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 17.01.2018
  Major features:
    - Hidden ores that require deep soil scanners to reveal them, and time.
    - Hydraulic cracking, allows to mine hidden ores with high pressure liquid injection.
    - Ferricupric ore, special hidden ore that can be refined into copper and iron, and coal with further research.
  Minor features:
    - Setting to disable satellite hidden ore discovery.
