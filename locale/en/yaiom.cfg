yaiom-ferricupric=Ferricupric ore

[recipe-name]
yaiom-ferricupric-cleaning=Ferricupric cleaning (petroleum gas, iron, copper)
yaiom-ferricupric-copper=Copper ore from ferricupric
yaiom-ferricupric-iron=Iron ore from ferricupric

[technology-name]
yaiom-fracking=Hydraulic fracturing
yaiom-ferricupric=Ferricupric ore
yaiom-advanced-ferricupric=Advanced ferricupric processing

[technology-description]
yaiom-fracking=Also known as fracking, allows for detection of deep patches of ore and to extract them via high pressure liquid injection.
yaiom-ferricupric=Alien ore whose extracted sludge can be extracted with light oil, and then cleaned off for traces of iron and copper.
yaiom-advanced-ferricupric=Further refining of ferricupric processing, allowing the collection of coal and copper/iron without losses.

[mod-setting-name]
yaiom-reveal-all=Reveal all YAIOM ore

[mod-setting-description]
yaiom-reveal-all=Reveals any YAIOM ore present in the map, currently and generated later. Revealed ore cannot be hidden again, but toggling this setting will restore the gimmick for any newly generated ore patches.
