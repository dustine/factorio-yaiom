[technology-name]
yaiom-hydraulic-fracturing=Hydraulic fracturing
yaiom-ferricupric=Ferricupric processing

[technology-description]
yaiom-hydraulic-fracturing=Also known as fracking, allows detection of deep patches of ore and then extract them with pressurized injection.
yaiom-ferricupric=Processing of this alien ore sludge, that can either give iron or copper with resorts of a radioactive catalyst.

[technology-effect]
yaiom-fracturing-scan=Satellites will (over time) reveal infinite ore patches

[mod-setting-name]
yaiom-reveal-all=Reveal all infinite ore

[mod-setting-description]
yaiom-reveal-all=Reveal all YAIOM ore present in the map, currently and generated later. Revealed ore cannot be hidden again, but toggling this setting will restore the gimmick for any newly spawned ore patches.
