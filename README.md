Factorio mod, Yet Another Infinite Ore Mechanic

Having issues finding reliable ore spots farther and farther away? Want some sustainable but non-trivial ore sources?

Look no further.

## Hydraulic fracturing

When you generate a map with this mod on, you may notice that there's blue/green/pink/... ores on the map generation preview, but once you're within the game, you can't find them.

Well, that's because they're generated deep underground, and you'll need to extract them if you want to reach them, using 

Researching **Hydraulic fracturing** (fracking) will unlock a deep soil radar that scans the floor for gravimetrical fluctuations deep underground, in the same radius as a basegame radar's active coverage (7x7 chunks). The miners for the ores will be unlocked with further research.

Place a radar down and let it run, as they take a while. Each deep soil radar takes at most around an hour in real time to finish scanning to its fullest width, and then deconstruct itself once done.

Deep soil radars won't scan chunks that have already been scanned (and revealed any deep ores), so spamming them around the terrain is the most efficient way to uncover the hidden ore.

## Ferricupric ore

The first (and only for now) ore added by the mod, being a mixture of hydrocarbonates and traces of both ferric and cupric (iron and copper, hence its name) weak acids. It shows on the minimap as a light blue, for ease of visibility. **It can produce copper, iron and eventually coal.**

Requires **light oil** to extract it from the floor, where high yields will require less oil per 1lu of ferricupric sludge (at the mininum yield, you get 1 sludge per 1 light oil used).

An early game setup for the sludge may look like this:

While a late game setup, requiring more research, may look like this:

*Note*: The earlier setup may still be of use even after unlocking the advanced ore refining, seeing that you get 1:1 on the return of petroleum gas, while you lose on maximum petroleum gas yield with the advanced setup.
